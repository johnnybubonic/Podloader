This script prepares, tags, signs, syncs, etc. episodes for the podcast Sysadministrivia (https://sysadministrivia.com/).

It's pretty self-explanatory, though- copy podloader.ini.dist to a file called podloader.ini and read through the comments for more info.

Upstream is at https://git.square-r00t.net/ but I keep a mirror at https://github.com/johnnybubonic/Podloader
